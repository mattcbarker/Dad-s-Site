  <img class="img-responsive" src="http://placehold.it/1200x300">
  <p>I love to draw and paint...I always have. I also love science and technology. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of art and human anatomy. I am inspired by Italian Renaissance masters whose draftsmanship and skills at creating emotionally compelling portraits and figures have stood the test of time.</p>
  <p>I draw and paint people as often as I can and I use traditional materials, paints, chalks and papers. I choose to portray the beauty, authenticity and sometimes vulnerablity I see in faces and figures... and in the fleeting moments in our everyday life.</p>
  <p>For me, creating work like this is a form of meditation and introspection. It is personally fufilling to me and I hope this comes through in my work.</p>
  <p>That's it...just capturing moments of beauty I see in faces and figures...it's that simple and not so deep.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in purchasing my art or would prefer a commisioned piece of someone special in your life, please fill out the form below and I will be happy to get in touch.</p>
